### Estimated Hours

I spent almost 10days to catch up on the first and second weeks lectures, that is not continuous days.

### Content Insights

I always like seeing a single-page design websign as this is satisfy my taste when it comes to designing. User can navigate
your design in just one page and not going to different pages. I find single-page design is very user friendly and can make
user more engaged to your website. I have very little knowledge on CMS before because I tried to published simple website
using apache for my local server and MySql for my data base before. Now with cloudbased CMS makes me more excited to learn it.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After hearing all the feedback from the lecture, now I can understand more on how website really been created. We all have been
tought to design a website before and published it on a very basic way. Then doing CMS is more of facing the reality of creating
a website on the preparation to employability aspect.
