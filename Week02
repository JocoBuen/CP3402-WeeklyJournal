### Estimated Hours

It took me a week to create a basic website from Joomla.

### Content and Insights

With the default theme cassiopea in Joomla, I tried outsourcing different packages and templates that I can use to create a single page design. With the package I used(phoca Cart), it is for creating a eCommerce site. Overall I am able to go around Joomla admin dashboard to edit the site.
