### Learning Activities

This week I setup a virtual machine to run my website locally, and used the VVV vagrant configuration.
Learning from the lecture 04 Deployment videos to get me started on how to configure my vm machine. With
the lecture resources I also learn the importance of having a local development environment before publishing it live.

### Content Insights

Staging environment is a good way to test and debug changes in a safe environment, without affecting the live 
website, Staging process can be use to our future project so everyone in the group can collaborate and develop 
a website before publishing live.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Staging evironment is a must skill of a web deloper, to collaborate with other developer and designer. The staging
environment also allows you to familiarise yourself to the CMS your using and a good way to practiec debugging and testing.
Clearly this is a skill I need to add to acquire a job related to web development, it can be an advantage to learn new set of skills.
